<div className='AboutMePar'> <p> I am 37 years old and I am from Ukraine. I have a degree in mechanical engineering and is approved by NOKUT. </p> <p>I am a positive and goal-oriented person who likes to learn something new and develop personally. I am married to a beautiful woman and have an intelligent son. In my free time, I like to travel with my family to different countries and go hiking in the mountains. My hobbies are cars and books. I have good proficiency in both Norwegian and Englsih.</p> <p>Some time ago I decided to supplement my engineering education and start studying coding, as I have always been interested in how it works and how the digital world works in general.</p>
